<p>Download jsURL and put this in the &lt;head&gt; of your code:</p>

<p>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../path/to/jsURL.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>To get the value of a URL parameter/variable use </p><pre>getValue("key");</pre>

<p>Key meaning the value of the parameter/variable.</p>

<h1>
<a name="example-usage" class="anchor" href="#example-usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example Usage</h1>

<p>Not getting it? That's cool. Here's a simple usage example to help you out.</p>

<p><b>Example URL:</b> yourwebsite.com/yourpage.html?yourvariablehere=yourvaluehere</p>

<pre>var urlparam = getValue("yourvariablehere");</pre>

<p>The script would then get the value of the varible in the address and return the value <i>"yourvaluehere"</i>, so the value of variable in your script would become <b>yourvaluehere</b>. Make sense?</p>

<p>I got this script a long time ago from an unknown source. But I've used it for over 2-3 years now, and and in that time I've actually improved it and thought I should share it with other coders. I in no way am saying this is 100% mine, but it was a lot worse before I improved it. Before, if your variable values had spaces, it would put <b>your+value+here</b>, annoying huh! But a simple url encoding and a lot of syntax and research fixed that. If you have any trouble feel free to contact me, I'd love to help you. I've been using this script for about 2-3 years and have done just about everything with it. I hardly use it anymore now that I've moved on to PHP (it seems intimidating but it just looks that way) and thought I shouldn't keep it to myself. Can't wait to see what you do with it! Cheers!</p>

<p>Contact me on <a href="http://brandon-jordan.weebly.com/contact-me">my website</a>, I've used this script for 2-3 years and have a lot of experience with it, and anything I don't know about, I'm willing to at least try to help you with.</p>
