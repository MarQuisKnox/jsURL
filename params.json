{"name":"jsURL","tagline":"Finally, a quick easy way to get url variables with JavaScript.","body":"Installation\r\n=====\r\n\r\nDownload jsURL and put this in the &lt;head&gt; of your code:\r\n\r\n<pre>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../path/to/jsURL.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo get the value of a URL parameter/variable use <pre>getValue(\"key\");</pre>\r\n\r\nKey meaning the name of the parameter/variable.\r\n\r\nExample Usage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nNot getting it? That's cool. Here's a simple usage example to help you out.\r\n\r\n<b>Example URL:</b> yourwebsite.com/yourpage.html?yourvariablehere=yourvaluehere\r\n\r\n<pre>var urlparam = getValue(\"yourvariablehere\");</pre>\r\n\r\nThe script would then get the value of the varible in the address and return the value <i>\"yourvaluehere\"</i>, so the value of variable in your script would become <b>yourvaluehere</b>. Make sense?\r\n\r\nCredits & Notes\r\n=====\r\nI got this script a long time ago from an unknown source. But I've used it for over 2-3 years now, and and in that time I've actually improved it and thought I should share it with other coders. I in no way am saying this is 100% mine, but it was a lot worse before I improved it. Before, if your variable values had spaces, it would put <b>your+value+here</b>, annoying huh! But a simple url encoding and a lot of syntax and research fixed that. If you have any trouble feel free to contact me, I'd love to help you. I've been using this script for about 2-3 years and have done just about everything with it. I hardly use it anymore now that I've moved on to PHP (it seems intimidating but it just looks that way) and thought I shouldn't keep it to myself. Can't wait to see what you do with it! Cheers!\r\n\r\nNeed help or have suggestions?\r\n=====\r\nContact me on <a href=\"http://brandon-jordan.weebly.com/contact-me\" target=\"_blank\">my website</a>, I've used this script for 2-3 years and have a lot of experience with it, and anything I don't know about, I'm willing to at least try to help you with.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
